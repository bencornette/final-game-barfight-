# final-game-barfight-
Summary
	You will play as an avatar that spawns in a bar scene. There will be at least three other enemies in the bar, each with different strength levels. You will start with a set strength level and your goal is to take down each enemy with a lower strength level than yours, and each fight you win, you gain strength, giving you the power to take each enemy down and win! 

	Summary: The goal was to get a simple fighting game that randomly generates different strength levels for each enemy and you gain strength each time you beat one.
Instructions: Approach the enemy using the arrow keys, and if you have a higher strength level than them, they will be defeated.
Technologies and techniques: I used simpleGE, random, and pygame with indexes, for loops, if statements and a filebase.

Process
•	I learned a lot more about programming and the importance of code placement
•	I got stuck making the movement and the win screen neither of which I still can't figure out :/
•	I would like to improve my "combat" system as well as the movement
•	Next time I would like to flesh out the finer details with more experience
•	I strayed by not having multiple enemies at once but everything is mostly how I imagined
•	I stayed on track by the motivation to fix my problems
